Although Sirtis was not confident with her audition, she still got the job, playing the role of Deanna Troi. Sirtis’ character in “Star Trek: The Next Generation” became a hit among its fandom, making her a household name. She played the half-human, half-betazoid counsellor and later in Starfleet for the entire seven seasons of the show, and captured the hearts of millions of viewers.

And the boss' wife was coming, you know? But we soon found out that she was nuttier than the rest of us, really! And she really fit in with this madcap atmosphere on the set. She was a delight. And actually what really made me happy was that as she did more and more episodes, especially toward the end of Next Gen and when she went on to DS9, they gave her episodes where you could really see what a great actress she was. She wasn't just the Auntie Mame of the galaxy, you know?

So... I actually used to call her "Mom". And when my own mother died, and I saw Majel soon after, I said to her "You know, you have to take care of yourself, because you're the only mom I've got left now..."

I don't know about the others, but I was a little scared, not so much when we were filming but when it came time for the first show to go on the air. We were being scrutinized so closely, especially by the press, and by the fans who were not happy about there being a new show at all.
