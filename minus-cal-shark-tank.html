These two individuals bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the <b>weight loss supplement</b> industry.</p><p>Crom Carmichael began his career as a columnist, captivating readers with his insightful perspectives on various topics. He later transitioned into the realm of business and politics, where he showcased his expertise as a commentator. As an <b>angel investor</b>, Crom has a keen eye for spotting emerging trends and promising ventures.</p><p>Barrett Jacques, on the other hand, embarked on a different path. He entered the <b>music industry</b> as a recording artist and talented <b>songwriter</b>, collaborating with renowned artists at <b>Sony Music Entertainment</b>. Barrett’s creative flair and passion for innovation make him the perfect partner in developing groundbreaking products.</p><p>“We knew that combining our unique skill sets and experiences would enable us to create something truly special in the weight loss industry.” – Crom Carmichael</p><p>“Music and entrepreneurship have always been my passions. Through Minus Cal, I get to explore both worlds and help people achieve their health goals.” – Barrett Jacques</p><p>Crom and Barrett’s diverse backgrounds and unwavering determination set the foundation for Minus Cal’s journey towards revolutionizing the weight loss market.</p><h2>Founding Minus Cal</h2><p>In 2017, Barrett Jacques had a vision to create a <b>healthy protein bar</b> that could aid in weight loss. As he was exploring various ingredients, he stumbled upon <b>Choleve extract</b> derived from <b>green tea</b>, known for its potential to block <b>fat absorption</b> in the <b>small intestine</b>. Intrigued by the idea, Barrett enlisted the help of Crom Carmichael, and together they formulated the Minus Cal bars using <b>Choleve extract</b>. With their innovative product in hand, they embarked on their entrepreneurial journey.</p><h3>The Science Behind Minus Cal Bars</h3><p><b>Green tea</b> has long been associated with health benefits, and <b>Choleve extract</b> takes it a step further in the quest for weight loss. The extract contains compounds that have been found to interfere with <b>fat absorption</b> in the <b>small intestine</b>, potentially aiding in weight management. By preventing the <b>small intestine</b> from absorbing fats, Minus Cal bars aimed to provide a natural solution for individuals looking to shed pounds.</p><p>“Our goal was to create a protein bar that not only satisfies hunger but also supports weight loss. With Choleve extract as a key ingredient, we believe our bars can positively impact <b>fat absorption</b> in the body,” said Barrett Jacques, co-founder of Minus Cal.</p><p>With this unique selling proposition, Minus Cal entered the market as a promising weight loss solution for health-conscious individuals.</p><p>The founders’ belief in the effectiveness of Choleve extract, combined with their passion for providing a <b>healthy protein bar</b> option, fueled their motivation to bring Minus Cal to fruition. They were determined to offer a product that not only tasted great but also had the potential to make a difference in people’s lives.</p><p>However, developing a new product and establishing a brand in a <b>competitive market</b> is no easy task. The founders faced numerous challenges, from sourcing high-quality ingredients to perfecting the taste of the bars. Through perseverance and dedication, they overcame these hurdles and were ready to introduce Minus Cal bars to the world.</p><h3>Bringing Minus Cal Bars to the Market</h3><p>In 2017, Minus Cal officially launched its healthy <b>protein bars</b>. The bars featured a unique combination of Choleve extract and other wholesome ingredients, making them a convenient snack option for individuals on a weight loss journey. With their bold claims of fat absorption prevention, Minus Cal bars aimed to differentiate themselves in the crowded protein bar market.</p><p>The founders leveraged the growing interest in <b>natural weight loss</b> solutions and positioned Minus Cal bars as an alternative to traditional diet pills and appetite suppressants. They believed that by offering a healthy and tasty protein bar, they could attract a wide range of consumers looking for a more sustainable and enjoyable approach to weight loss.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Minus-Cal-Bars-1024x585.jpg alt="Minus Cal Bars" title="Minus Cal Bars" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><table><tr><th>Key Features of Minus Cal Bars</th><th>Benefits</th></tr><tr><td><b>Healthy protein bar</b></td><td>A convenient snack option packed with essential nutrients</td></tr><tr><td>Choleve extract</td><td>Potential contribution to blocking fat absorption in the small intestine</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesome ingredients</td><td>Nutritious components to support overall well-being</td></tr><tr><td>Tasty flavors</td><td>An enjoyable snack to satisfy cravings</td></tr></table><p>The founders were committed to transparency and ensured that the ingredients used in their bars were of the highest quality.

They eagerly awaited feedback and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people’s health and well-being.</p><h2>Shark Tank Pitch</h2><p>In Season 11 of Shark Tank, Crom and Barrett presented their innovative weight loss supplement, Minus Cal, in a bid to secure a significant investment. They sought <b>$500</b>,000 in exchange for a <b>20% equity stake</b> in their company.</p><p>Crom and Barrett passionately pitched the product to the Sharks, highlighting its unique fat-blocking capabilities. They backed up their claims with scientific research, emphasizing the potential benefits for individuals seeking natural weight loss solutions.</p><p>“Minus Cal is not just another <b>fat-burning pill</b>.
