These locks were designed exclusively for self-storage facilities and have been the industry standard since their introduction. Bolt cutters cannot be used to remove disc locks because the hasp (or the U-shaped component of a padlock) cannot be accessed from the inside. A disc lock cannot be broken apart with a hammer, unlike a padlock or a keyless lock, which may be done with a hammer.

Jim Shore is a huge fan of mine.
Yes they are mass manufactured in China so that the Jim Shore Corporation/ Enesco could take advantage of cheap labour.
The bottom sticker reads “made in China.” It was done well if it was mass produced.

高校も神奈川の桐蔭学園という学費の高い名門を出てるということで、実家がお金持ちであることが想像できます。
ある時にはピアニストの美人の母親とツーショットの写真をインスタにアップしたり、秀才な兄貴の存在が露わになったり、華麗な一族であることが世間に広がりました。
ただ、父親だけはインスタなどには登場せず、詳細は不明です。
野田洋次郎さんがお父さんの仕事の都合で幼少期をアメリカで過ごしたという背景から、海外転勤もあり得るような仕事をしてることが想像できます。
さらには子供２人を高校、大学と名門に通わせることができるほどにお金持ちであります。
ネット上では、
”ずっと海外にいる”
”フランス国籍”
など、かなり謎な情報ばかりです。
今日は、野田洋次郎さんのお父さんについて、わかっていること、噂程度の情報などをまとめて書いてみたいと思います。
野田洋次郎は父の仕事の都合で幼少期をアメリカで過ごす RADWIMPSの楽曲を聴いたことある方は、野田洋次郎さんの英語の発音の良さを知っていると思います。
なぜ、野田洋次郎さんの英語が上手なのかというと、帰国子女だからです。
野田洋次郎さんは日本の東京都に生まれ、日本の幼稚園に通っていましたが、父親の仕事の影響で卒園まで残り３ヶ月というタイミングでアメリカのテネシー州・ナッシュビルに引っ越すことになったのです。
野田洋次郎さんは英語がうまい理由を聞かれ、「英語を喋らざるを得ないような環境にいたから」と発言しています。
ちなみに、幼稚園卒園ギリギリにアメリカに行ったこと自体も子供にとっては苦しいことでありましたが、アメリカに行っても転校の連続で、常にいじめられているという環境だったそうです。
帰国子女であることを誇らしげに語る方は多いですが、野田洋次郎さんの場合は少しネガティブな感じで語ることが多いです。
また、野田洋次郎さんは子供の頃から父親との関係はあまり良くなかったそうです。
やはり父の転勤で過酷な環境にいたこと、友達が作れなかったことが影響してるとされています。
野田洋次郎と父親の仲の悪さ。ゲーム買ってもらえず仲間はずれ、家でも敬語 お父さんが海外に転勤した影響で友達が作れなかった野田洋次郎さん。
家では敬語を使わないといけなかったなど、かなり堅苦しい生活模様でした。
また、ゲームを禁止にされていたこともあったそうで、当時「ゲームないと仲間はずれにされちゃう」と父に訴えると「ゲームないぐらいで仲間はずれにするような友達はいらん」と結局買ってもらえなかったそうです。
野田洋次郎さんは20歳の頃に父に、
「僕はあなたの子供に生まれたことがずっと嫌だった」と告白し、
父は「俺もいきなり親になってわからなかった」と答えたそうです。
洋次郎さんは父の気持ちを理解し「自分も親になった時同じように苦労するんだろう」と思ったそうです。
和解したというよりも、理解できたという表現の方が正しいのかもしれません。
野田洋次郎の父の名前は「昇」と「ニック・ノダ」？仕事は日産VPの噂 野田洋次郎さんはお父さんの仕事の都合で幼少期にアメリカ・テネシー州のナッシュビルに引っ越しました。
お父さんの仕事を憶測するには、1980年代にテネシー州に進出していた日本の企業を特定するのが早いです。
また、野田洋次郎さんがお父さんについて、「フランス国籍でフランスに住んでいる」と発言していたということで、フランスにも関わりのある企業に絞れば特定できそうです。
1980年代にテネシー州に進出していた企業は、有名なところで「ブリジストン」と「日産」です。
そして、日産はフランスの車会社「ルノー」と関連性があります。
つまり、野田洋次郎さんのお父さんが働いてる企業は日産関係の可能性が極めて高いです。
野田洋次郎のお父さんニック・ノダ（昇）は2005年に欧州日産の総務担当副社長？ 日産関係の英語ページで「noda」という名前で検索をすると、2005年に「ニック・ノダ」という人物が欧州日産の総務担当副社長に任命されたことを知られせるページが見つかります。
さらに、フランスを拠点に置くことも書かれております。
ニック・ノダという人物は結婚して二人の子供がいると書かれているので、野田洋次郎さんの家族構成と合致します。
一橋大学を卒業し、日本の日産の座間工場の人事課、北米日産で4年間、一度日本の日産に戻った後に欧州日産のキャリアを担当したと書かれています。
野田洋次郎さんが日本に戻った時期などと重ねると、キャリアも合致するので、実の父の可能性は高いです。
ちなみにニック・ノダさんは2005年から2009年まで欧州日産の総務担当副社長を担当し、2009年からは「カルソニックカンセイ株式会社」（現在のマレリ）という日産関係の部品メーカーに移ったそうです。
フェイスブックで父の名前「昇」が特定？ ちなみにニック・ノダというのは、お父さんのフランスでの名前で本名ではありません。
フェイスブックで「野田」という苗字で、一橋大学を卒業して日産に務めた方を検索すると、「野田昇」さんという方が検索に引っ掛かります。
ザ・エリートなページでありました。
ちなみに過去に出回った直近のお父さんの写真と、この野田昇さんの顔はそっくりです。
ほぼ本人で間違いないと思われます。
野田洋次郎のお父さんは2017年に仕事を引退？ 野田洋次郎さんは2017年にツイッターでお父さんが仕事をリタイアしたことを祝福するツイートをしていました。
今日は父親の仕事引退のお祝いを家族でしてきた。甥っ子と姪っ子にも会って幸せを存分に頂いてきた。
4歳の甥っ子は毎日ラッドを聴いてくれてるらしく「『洗脳』いい曲だよねぇ〜」って褒めてくれた。嬉しかった。
「洗脳」を誉めた4歳の甥っ子のセンスが気になりますが、親族揃ってお父さんの仕事引退を祝福したということで、今はとても仲良しだということが伺えますね。
野田洋次郎のお父さんの現在。国立天文台三鷹キャンパス？世田谷の豪邸と千葉の別荘 若い頃はアメリカのテネシー州にロス、そしてフランスと海外を飛び回った洋次郎さんのお父さん。
2017年に仕事を引退したとされていますが、フェイスブックのページでは現在は「国立天文台三鷹キャンパス」に勤務していると書かれています。
仕事自体は続けているものの、以前よりもゆとりのある勤務体系で余裕を持って働いてることが考えられます。
以前に週刊誌に野田洋次郎さんの実家の詳細が載っていましたが、世田谷に地下一階地上二階で大きなガレージに高級車が２台停まっているような豪邸だったそうです。
お父さんのFacebookには千葉にある別荘の写真がアップされていました。
若い頃にバリバリに仕事を頑張った人の引退後の人生は、やはり美しいです。
実はお父さんもピアノが上手。家族でライブができる？ 野田洋次郎さんと兄貴、そしてお母さんも音楽家で有名ですが、実はお父さんもピアノが上手です。
野田洋次郎さんのインスタにお父さんのピアノを弾く姿がアップされていましたが、その腕前にファンは驚愕していました。</description></item><item><title>49ers minutia minute: How Nick Bosa, Chase Young were aligned vs. Jaguars</title><link>/49ers-snap-counts-jaguars-bosa-young.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/49ers-snap-counts-jaguars-bosa-young.html</guid><description>The Athletic has live coverage of Jaguars vs Bengals on Monday Night Football.

The presence of excessive moisture in the basement is the most frequent reason for the growth of mushrooms and mould in the basement.
